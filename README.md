Hospital Readmission Prediction and Cost Analysis
Overview
This project leverages machine learning to predict hospital readmissions and analyze associated costs. By identifying key factors influencing readmissions, it helps hospitals optimize treatment plans, improve patient care, and reduce financial burdens.

Features
✅ Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and structuring patient data for analysis.
✅ Machine Learning Model: Predicting patient readmission risks.
✅ Feature Selection: Identifying critical factors contributing to readmissions.
✅ Cost Analysis: Assessing the financial impact of readmissions.
✅ Data Visualization: Presenting insights through charts and reports.
